- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Robinator9002
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, AI Research and simmilar
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently studying Data Science and building my own Software Engineering Projects
- I'm partially working as Freelancer

My current Projects include OptiFlow, Rental Management Optimization Software, split into two sepperate Projects (FileManager and FormManager, alltough im currently focused onto the FileManager, and the FormManager was more like a Demo), which i develop as Freelancing, and the Model Asset Loader, which is a Custom Project i develop for simplifying the Process of loading AI Models like Chatgbots and Image Models, and then automatically installing them in the right directories (for apps like ComfyUI, Llama, A1111,...).
